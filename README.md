AppFoundation is a set of common swift utilities I find myself regularly needing in my projects.

AppFoundation currently distributed exclusively through the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/).

]
```

To add AppFoundation as a dependency to an Xcode Project: 

- Choose `File` â†’ `Add Packages...`

Other distribution mechanisms like CocoaPods or Carthage may be added in the future.
